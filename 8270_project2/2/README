Project description: Using flex, we had to built a translator(etol) for converting english text to l337(leet) alphabet and back to english text with another translator(ltoe).


What I have done to augment the leet obfuscation is: used advanced l337 alphabet where lettes are more obscure and contains more than one character for each letter in alphabet. For some letters, there was only one corresponding leet symbol that is common, such as e and v, so I defined my own leet symbol for them. I defined the symbol "'&," for e and "~\/~" for v. 



The easiest part of this project: finding leet codes online

Problems that I had in completing this project:  How to preserve the caps when converting back to english from leet was what I found most challenging. I also thought if I should use a FIFO data structure like queue to store the alphabet strings, which would call push_back operation on the underlying container, so thought to use += opeator instead.
